# OpenPose

## Description

The OpenPose human pose recognition project can realize pose estimation such as human motion, facial expression, and finger movement. It is suitable for single and multiple people, and has excellent robustness. It is the world 's first real-time multi-person two-dimensional pose estimation application based on deep learning.
